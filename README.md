# Player Profiling on League of Legend Data
This Project seeks to determine different playing styles by developing player personas based on game statistics and finally determining which particular style of play produces the most wins.


The approach would be to develop:
- A player style segmentation based on game stats (K Means)
- Perform a driver analysis on those determined clusters (Supervised ML)
- Sythesize results with other player attributes
