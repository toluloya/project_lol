# Analysis
The different stages of this project would be broken down by keys.

## 100: Data Extraction and Processing
- Data was loaded in
- Data was merged to obtain a full data on each player
- Some data quality checks was performed
- Required columns was selected
- Final processed Data was saved

## 101: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Simple statisical analyses was calculated
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA) was conducted on the game statistics data
- The PCs were added as new features to the dataset

## 102: Exploratory Data Analysis
The same as in 101, just on new data that collects stats based on the first 10 mins of game play

## 200: Model Development - Initial Steps
- Intial Model Development
- Traditional Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms were performed on data
- Metrics tracked included: Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision and Recall
- Further Steps were listed at the end

## 400: Model Development - PCA Dataset
- Built model on PCA Dataset derived from 102
- Traditional Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms were performed on data
- Metrics tracked included: Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision and Recall
- Compared results with 200

## 410: Deep Learning
- Trained a DL model on game data
- Metrics tracked included: Accuracy and F1 Score
- Compared results with 200
